# ComplexOperations
Basic mathematical operations on complex numbers in python <br>

V 0.1: <br>
- Using numpy arrays to hold the reals (index 0) and the imaginary (index 1)
- Making basic function operations for complex numbers (two array inputs)
- Using a function that prints the array as a string to display the results of the operation/complex number
<br>

V 0.1.1: <br>
- Adding a polar to rectangular form
- adding a specific arctangent function
<br>

V 0.1.2: <br>
- Added natural log function for complex numbers
- Added exponentiation by euler's number for complex numbers
- Began to type for the Extended Logarithms and Complex Exponentiation by Complex Numbers
<br>

V 0.1.3: <br>
- Added extended logarithm function for complex numbers
- Added Complex Exponentiation by Complex Numbers
<br>

V 0.1.4: <br>
- Imported Trigonometric Function extensions that I have been developing but not documenting
- Began place for Inverse Trig functions :<
